## Decisions taken

- Use of **yarn**
  - https://bun.sh/docs/installation
  - Faster than npm
  - More stable ~~boring~~ than bun
    - https://yarnpkg.com/blog/bun

## Notes about Expo

- [Expo examples](https://github.com/expo/examples)
- We have Expo Push Notifications
- You don't need to eject from Expo anymore. Now, the solution is [Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/)
- You need to install de dependencies running `yarn expo install <library-name>`, not with `yarn/npm install <library-name>`, since not all npm libreries work correctly with Expo and they keep their own versions.
